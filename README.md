# GoSSPI
*GoSSPI* is a Go version of [NodeSSPI](https://github.com/abbr/nodesspi) allowing automatic login for users in Windows domains by reading the `WWW-Authenticate` header value and validating it with the *Security Support Provider Interface* in Windows.

It is possible this project will simply become a pull request to add an example to [alexbrainman/sspi](https://github.com/alexbrainman/sspi).
